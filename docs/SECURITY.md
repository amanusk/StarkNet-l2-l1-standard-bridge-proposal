## Reporting a Vulnerability

This is experimental software and a proof of concept. This should not (currently) be used in production applications.

If there are any vulnerabilities in **bifrost**, don't hesitate to _report them_ by opening an issue

1. Describe the vulnerability.

   If you have a fix, that is most welcome -- please attach or summarize it in your message!

2. We will evaluate the vulnerability and, if necessary, release a fix or mitigating steps to address it. We will contact you to let you know the outcome, and will credit you in the report.
